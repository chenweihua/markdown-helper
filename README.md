### About 

You can drop more than one img to .py script above  and it will auto runs and generates markdown url which save in txt file  
,so you **do not have to open the Browser and Select a img from Complex path and Upload and Get url**.

In the latest version,you even do not have to open txt file, you just drop a img above .py script and the markdown url is in your clipboard now. 

what you should do next is **Ctrl + v** or Right-click and paste it in your markdown editor! 
md_url in your editor. 


All you can see just like gif pic at the last.
